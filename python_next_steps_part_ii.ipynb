        "\n",
        "\"In iteration control structures, a statement or block is executed until the program reaches a certain state, or operations have been applied to every element of a collection. This is usually expressed with keywords such as `while`, `repeat`, `for`, or `do..until`. The basic attribute of an iteration control structure is to be able to repeat some lines of code. The visual display of iteration creates a circular loop pattern when flowcharted, thus the word 'loop' is associated with iteration control structures.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Breaking down that definition:\n",
        "- Iteration (repetition of a process) is a type of control structure\n",
        "- In programming languages, iteration involves lines of code repeating until a condition is met of the end of a group of values has been reached.\n",
        "- Because iteration in this context involves a circular pattern, many object-oriented programming languages refer to these structures as `loops`\n",
